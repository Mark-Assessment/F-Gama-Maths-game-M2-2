  ### Automated testing (TDD)
We can use code to test our code. which has several advantages over the manual testing method. Many hundreds of tests can be run against a project in a short space of time, and as tests are usually written by the  programmer during development, errors are picked up early. In other words, automated software testing is quicker, efficient, and specific.

However, tests are only as good as the questions we ask & tests can end up as purely decorative giving a false impression. Automated tests don't test the User Experience either, so the best testing strategy is a combination of both automated and user tests. 

### Jest
I have used the Jest JavaScript Testing Framework to develop automated test for the Bug Match game. Test-Driven development is to develop code incrementally in the following way: write tests that we know will fail and then, we write just enough code to get the test to pass - without breaking any previous tests. Finally, to think about ways that we can improve or refactor our code.  This cycle is known as Red-Green-Refactor. Finally a suite of tests can be run for complete app, by typing one command into the terminal -  npm test.

I have used Jest as an introduction to automated testing to test code already written. The next stage in my development will be to implement this testing process as the product is being built.

### Requirements:
Before running the tests, a modification is required in script.js: comment out the EmailJS & modal scripts as well as line 15 appending the squares container to the DOM. 

### Testing the Array of Objects 
Checks if an array of objects: 
1. contains a specific value.
![View](/docs/jest_tests/jest-test-cardArray-contains-specific-value.png)
2. contains a specific object.
![View](/docs/jest_tests/jest-test-cardArray-contains-specific-value.png)

### Testing the number of specific elements contained within an html page 
1. h3 should exist.
2. three buttons should exist.

## Manual testing (BDD)
Behaviour-Driven development is based on  the expected outcome of an action, to see if an app behaves as expected. BDD builds on the user stories, extending this by adding Given, Then, and When  - so given (a specific context), when (a specific action is carried out), then (a particular set of observable consequences should occur). The behaviour is now testable, and repeatable. Manual testing is time consuming
 
## BDD example with Bug Match
As a user, when I arrive at the webpage. 
- I want to be able to click a maximum of two squares, so that each square flips and displays an image.
- I want the flipped squares if they donâ€™t match to be flipped back in the game so I can have another go.
- I want the flipped squares if they do match to be flipped back and disabled, and be counted as a match on the scoreboard.

# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
 * First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game and learn more about the times table.

       * Upon launching a game, user can easily understand how to play the game by accessing the help icon. 
       
       * On click of the "Start Game" question will be generated with random numbers. 
       
       * Timer will be shown for the user to know how long to play. On choosing right answer, score will be incremented.

       * The moment timer reaches to zero game over message is displayed

       * Reset the game any time by clicking on the "Reset Game"

       ![](?raw=true)
       
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        * The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

        * At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure      the  user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
            
        * On the Contact Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

        ![](?raw=true)
        
        ![](?raw=true)

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        * Once the new visitor has read the About page and What I Do text, they will notice the qualification and use of online service.

        * The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

        * At the bottom of the Contact page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the person on social media which highlights the links to them.

        ![](?raw=true)

        ![](?raw=true)



 *  Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added reviews about the tutor.

       * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the reviews section.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new subjects are added.

       * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the subjects.

# Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
# Known Bugs
* Hover effects don't work on the navigation bar
  * I tried fixing hover effects on a nav bar but somehow Bootstrap is overriding the CSS. Since there is not much impact on the UX and there are clear redirection provided I left it unfixed

# Credits
## Code
* [Bootstrap 5.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) Bootstrap was used significantly throughout the project to make it responsive. I used the Grid system as well as inputting a fixed-top navbar, a progress bar and contact form.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was used to help me style the navbar text colour and was used in HTML to close the navbar when a link is clicked on mobile.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was used to provide a smooth scroll to the website and to style the contact form and the submit button.

* [Courses.Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/level5diplomainwebappdevelopment) was used to style the progress bars and I used the demonstrated jQuery for the contact form.
